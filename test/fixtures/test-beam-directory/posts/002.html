  <h1>Rebirth</h1>
  <p>Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Goodbye, friends.  I never thought I'd die like this.  But I always really hoped. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.</p>
