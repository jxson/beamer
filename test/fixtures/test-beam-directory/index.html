  <h1>The Luck of the Fryrish</h1>
  <p>When will that be? Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? A sexy mistake. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.</p>
